# Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project is a Sales Analysis Dashboard that allows users to gain insights into sales data by using Power BI and MySQL. The dashboard provides visualizations of revenue by products and customers, revenue by year, top 5 products, top 5 customers, and top 5 revenue years. The dataset used in this project contains 2 lakh rows of sales data, and it has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove duplicates.

Also I had included the whole process in the Documentation.
